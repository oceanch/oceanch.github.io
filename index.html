Research Interest and Experiences
Current research interests mainly focus on autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, 5G, ad-hoc networks in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Working as a Research Fellow at the Institute for Communication Systems (ICS) of the University of Surrey, since the graduation of PhD in Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey. Involved in multiple European funded projects in FP7, EPSRC sponsored project, and International collaborations:

Mar. 2016 – present (5 years) TASCC-Cloud-Assisted Real-time Methods for Autonomy
EPSRC and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) jointly sponsored project, with a consortium of institutions and industries, including University of Warwick, Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), Nokia HERE, THALES, Telefonica.
To design and validate a novel, Secure Cloud-based Distributed Control (SCDC) framework to enable implementation of safe and robust semi-autonomous functions on autonomous vehicles.
My role: WP3 leader; Task 1.2 leader in WP1. (helped secure the funding)

Jul. 2014 – present (5 years) 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC) – Light MAC and RRM Jointly sponsored by the UK Government and a consortium of telecom industries, including BT, BBC, Huawei, Vodafone, Samsung, Rohde & Schwarz, Cobham, Fujitsu, EE, Telefonica, Ofcom and Aircom. The 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC) at the University of Surrey is the UK’s only research centre dedicated to the next generation of mobile communications. WA3 focuses on the design of scalable, reliable and energy-efficient MAC protocols within the 5G architecture.
My role: Technical consultant in WA3; Supervision of PhDs on light MAC and small cell projects.

Feb. 2013 – May 2015 (2 years) Huawei-Surrey ITS
Purely funded by the Huawei Technology Co. LTD, Beijing China Collaboration with the fast developed Chinese communication partner Huawei Technology on the research topics within the scope of communications in vehicular networks, especially on the DSRC based vehicular networks and Hybrid Vehicular Networks (HVN).
My role: Project coordinator; Key researcher on DSRC communications. (helped secure the funding)

Jan. 2010 – Jul. 2013 (2.5 years) DRIVE C2X
European Commission sponsored FP7 project.
DRIVE-C2X is a large scale European project with 32 partners, 10 support partners, and total budget of 18.9 million Euros. DRIVE C2X aims to lay the foundation for rolling out cooperative transport systems based on Car to Car Communications which is expected to lead to a safer, more economical and more ecological land transport systems. The University of Surrey team contributes to this project in multiple work packages, such as system specification, test environment, data and data quality, and impact assessment.
My role: Key researcher on impact analysis of large-scale simulations; Supervision of MSc student on use case development.

Mar. 2009 – Jan. 2010 (2 years) PRE-DRIVE C2X
European Commission sponsored FP7 project.
PRE-DRIVE C2X aims to support a common European Communication architecture on V2V and V2I communications and develop a detailed system specification, verified prototype to be used in field operational tests. The University of Surrey team contributes to the specification, descriptions of use cases, use case development and implementation, and performance analysis of ITS applications including the impact on traffic efficiency and fuel consumption.
My role: Key researcher on V2X MAC issues; Supervision of MSc student on use case development.

Jul. 2006 – Sep. 2006 (2 months) SIEMENS CT (Corporate Technology), Beijing, P.R.CHINA
Intern in the Department of Information Security. Providing the safety framework of GPRS & WAP to China Mobile (Sichuan Province Branch).
